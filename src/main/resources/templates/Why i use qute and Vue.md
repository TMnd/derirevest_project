If you are reading this odd file you must have notice that I am using Vue.js as a frontend framework, and you may be asking why the hell this guy is using the quarkus's template engine QUTE for a couple of operations while the rest of the project is using vue?

Well the reason is quite simple, it is for learning purpose. This pet project is to learn Quarkus backend and Vue frontend, so there is no reason to take advantage to tip my toe into QUTE.

I know mixing server rendering and client rendering is not a very good idea in a production product, however in a learning env why not to do it?
